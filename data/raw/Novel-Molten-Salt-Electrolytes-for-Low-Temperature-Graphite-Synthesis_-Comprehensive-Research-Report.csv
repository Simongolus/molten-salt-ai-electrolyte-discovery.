"Executive Summary"
"The electrochemical synthesis of graphite from CO₂ and other carbon precursors in molten salt electrolytes has"
"emerged as a transformative approach to address both carbon emissions and critical material supply challenges."
"This technology operates at temperatures as low as 126°C to 900°C (compared to traditional Acheson process"
"at >3000°C), offering potential energy savings of 80-95% while simultaneously capturing CO₂. Recent"
"breakthroughs (2023-2025) include novel electrolyte compositions, AI-driven catalyst discovery, and improved"
"understanding of electrochemical mechanisms."
