Data from: NIST Properties of Molten Salts Database (formerly SRD 27)

Introduction

NIST distributed the NIST Properties of Molten Salts Database from
1990 to 2004. As part of the NIST Standard Reference Data Program, the
database was designated as Standard Reference Database 27 or SRD
27. Since the database has not been actively maintained since 1991 the
SRD designation has been dropped. The database was distributed as a
program for DOS(1) compatible operating systems. To enable use of the
data on modern systems, the data have been extracted into comma
separated variable (CSV) files. The CSV format should be readable by
various programs and provides a stable format for long term
preservation of the data.

About the database

The database was designed to provide engineers and scientists rapid
access to critically evaluated data for inorganic salts in the molten
state. Properties include density, viscosity, electrical conductance,
and surface tension, although not all properties are given for all
salts. Properties for approximately 320 single salts and 4,000
multi-component systems are included, the latter being primarily
binary. Some data for more complex salt mixtures are also given.  Data
were abstracted from the literature over the period 1890-1990.

These data are no longer considered
Standard Reference Data. Information on the copyright status of this
data can be found on the NIST web site at

About the data in this distribution

In order to make the data from the database available to the public,
the data from the original database program has been extracted into
four comma-separated-variable (CSV) files. The data and accompanying
comments were extracted from text files which were used by the
database program. The original files were in a non-standard format.

There is one file for each of the properties covered by the
database. Although the files are in CSV format, they are provided with
a .txt extension. This is done to safeguard against programs which
attempt to automatically elucidate data types. The second column in
all data files contains the composition range. Some programs may
interpret some of these values as dates, not text. When importing this
data into another program, the contents of this column should always
be treated as plain text.
