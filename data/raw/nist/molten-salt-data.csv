"Data from: NIST Properties of Molten Salts"

"Introduction"
"NIST distributed the NIST Properties of Molten Salts Database from 1990 to 2004. As part of the NIST"
"Standard Reference Data Program, the database was designated as Standard Reference Database 27 or"
"SRD 27. Since the database has not been actively maintained since 1991 the SRD designation has been"
"dropped. The database was distributed as a program for DOS1 compatible operating systems. To enable"
"use of the data on modern systems, the data have been extracted into comma separated variable (CSV)"
"files. The CSV format should be readable by various programs and provides a stable format for long term"
"preservation of the data. This document explains how the contents of the CSV files should be"
"interpreted."
""
"About the database"
"The database was designed to provide engineers and scientists rapid access to critically evaluated data"
"for inorganic salts in the molten state. Properties include density, viscosity, electrical conductance, and"
"surface tension, although not all properties are given for all salts. Properties for approximately 320"
"single salts and 4,000 multi-component systems are included, the latter being primarily binary. Some"
"data for more complex salt mixtures are also given."
""
"Data were abstracted from the literature over the period 1890-1990. The primary data sources are given"
"in the references section below. These publications give references to the research papers and describe"
"the methods of data evaluation."
""
"These data are no longer considered Standard Reference Data. Information on the copyright status of"
"this data can be found on the NIST web site at https://www.nist.gov/topics/data/public-access-nist-"

""
"About the data in this distribution"
"In order to make the data from the database available to the public, the data from the original database"
"program has been extracted into four comma-separated-variable (CSV) files. The data and"
"accompanying comments were extracted from text files which were used by the database program. The"
"original files were in a non-standard format."
""
"There is one file for each of the properties covered by the database. Although the files are in CSV"
"format, they are provided with a .txt extension. This is done to safeguard against programs which"
"attempt to automatically elucidate data types. The second column in all data files contains the"
"composition range. Some programs may interpret some of these values as dates, not text. When"

"Any mention of commercial products is for information only; it does not imply recommendation or endorsement"

"importing this data into another program, the contents of this column should always be treated as plain"
"text."

"Files in this distribution"
"This distribution contains the following files:"

"Data file format"
"All four data files are formatted similarly. They consist of the following:"
""
"•   A single entry stating the quantity provided and the units used."
"•   A blank line"
"•   A line with text descriptions of the data in each column."
"•   Many lines of data"
"•   A blank line"
"•   Three one-entry lines describing the source of the data."
"•   A blank line"
"•   A line with a single large entry describing the data format."
